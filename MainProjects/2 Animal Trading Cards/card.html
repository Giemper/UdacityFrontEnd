			<p>The coyote appears often in the tales and traditions of Native Americansâ€”usually as a very savvy and clever beast. Modern coyotes have displayed their cleverness by adapting to the changing American landscape. These members of the dog family once lived primarily in open prairies and deserts, but now roam the continent's forests and mountains. </p>
			<p>They have even colonized cities like Los Angeles, and are now found over most of North America. Coyote populations are likely at an all-time high.</p>
