# UdacityFrontEnd
Projects done in the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree.

## Main Projects
**Main Projects** folder contains all the major projects made for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. 
These projects are like _homework_ asigned by Udacity at the end of every lesson on the course.
Some of the projects make use of third-party libraries like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), and code made by the Udacity team.

## Small Projects
The **Small Projects** folder contains the smaller content made within lessons in the Nanodegree.
Not to be _lazy_, but some of these projects contain plenty of commented code. That's because these are intended mainly for practice and reference. 
Just like in the **Main Projects**, some of these projects contain third-party library, and code made by the Udacity Team.
